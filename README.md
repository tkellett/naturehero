We designed our web app for the Blackrock challenge. Our goal is to impove community engagement of the Green Team. To achieve that, we decided to develop a gamified-habit web app. In this app, administrators can add tasks for users to complete. When users engage with that tasks gamified features of the web app will keep them engaged. Our web app have gamified features such as: a level system, an achievement system, social features and daily streak mechanic. Our vision for level system is that when you complete a task you gain experience points and when you gain enough experience points your hero level up. This will give users a satisfying feeling after completing a task. Our vision for achievement system is that after doing certain things you will get an achievement badge which you can showcase in your profile and it will be shown in the social feed. Our vision for the social feed is that you can see the achievements of your friends which will have a positive effect on motivation. Also there will be a profile page for users in which they can display their achievements and statistics such as: percent of tasks done in time, streaks(consecutive days of opening the web app) and the number of friends. All this features aim to motivate users to engage with the tasks Green Team sets for them and help Green Team to engage with the community.
